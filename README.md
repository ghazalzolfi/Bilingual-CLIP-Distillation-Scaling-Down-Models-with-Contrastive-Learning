# Knowledge Distillation using Contrastive Learning (CLIP Loss)

This repository demonstrates the practical implementation of knowledge distillation using contrastive learning, specifically employing the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) loss. It focuses on transferring knowledge from a large monolingual model to a smaller multilingual model using paired English-Persian textual datasets. Due to resource constraints, the exercise utilizes smaller batch sizes to illustrate the mechanics rather than aiming for optimal real-world performance.

### Project Overview:

### **1. Knowledge Distillation:**
- **Objective**: Transfer performance from a large, resource-intensive model ("teacher") to a smaller, efficient "student" model.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Leveraged intermediate representations and contrastive learning to effectively distill knowledge.
  - Demonstrated distillation from monolingual (English) to multilingual (English-Persian) contexts.

### **2. Contrastive Learning with CLIP Loss:**
- **Objective**: Align textual representations in a shared embedding space using contrastive loss.
- **Methodology**:
  - Applied CLIP loss for contrastive learning, enhancing cross-modal embedding alignment.
  - Managed computational constraints by using reduced batch sizes, clearly showing the training dynamics despite practical limitations.

### **3. CLIP Model Background:**
- Explained the theoretical foundation and benefits of using CLIP for cross-modal embeddings, emphasizing its zero-shot generalization capabilities.
- Described contrastive loss mechanisms, focusing on the alignment of paired samples and distinguishing negative examples within embedding spaces.

### Key Learning Outcomes:
- Practical insights into knowledge distillation techniques and their implementation in PyTorch.
- Understanding of contrastive learning, particularly CLIP loss, and its application to cross-lingual and cross-modal representation alignment.
- Hands-on experience with challenges and solutions in training large models under resource-constrained conditions.

### Libraries and Tools Used:
- Python
- PyTorch (Model implementation and training)
- NumPy (Numerical operations)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

This project provides foundational and practical knowledge in contrastive learning techniques, specifically knowledge distillation, relevant to resource-efficient machine learning deployment scenarios.
